<h1 class="title"> WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF SEGMENTATION </h1> <br>
<p class="subtitle"> Welcome to Image Segmentation application. This application can be used to perform the following tasks.
    <li> Upload a image you want to do Segmentation . </li>
    <li> The model will predict the segments in the image as  different classes in COCO dataset  . </li>
    <li> It will give output, based on our Pre-trained Segmentation model. </li>


    </p>

    <p> Click on <a href={{ url_for('file_upload') }}>UPLOAD</a> to upload an image .</p>

<p>
For complete usage of this application, view the rules defined below for various tasks.
</p>

<h3> Rules for Uploading a Image </h3>
<li> Data Set must be a image format jpg,jpeg,png.... </li>
<li> One image can be uploaded once. Multiple images cannot be uploaded at a time. </li>

<br>


<h3> Information regarding the Model Selected</h3>
<li> In our case, we use the pretrained Deeplab network with Xception background  </li>
<li> The model was trained on  different classes on COCO dataset .</li>
<li> DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image. </li>
